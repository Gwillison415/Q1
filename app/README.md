## Synopsis

This project is aimed at allowing you to query cities of interest and see what air quality data is for each city. **This is majorly a work in progress**.

## Code Example

This library is intended to help people who are interested in air quality measurements at a glance. It pulls JOSN data from Open Air Quality and projects it into a table on the bottom of the screen.

## Motivation

This project exists because I am interested in air quality as a member of the community and someone who is  especially interested in our environment and the data that helps elucidate our world.

## Installation

No Installation required! Please head over to   ____________  and punch in a city and a date.
